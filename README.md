# YaSTM32lib - Yet another STM32 library

STM32 library for bare-metal application.

**ATTENTION**  
This library is currently still under development and cannot used for production. This note will be removed in the *README.md* when the status changes. This repository is only a backup from my local repository. Because I don't use ST's CMSIS and HAL it's a big work for me to implement all peripheral from the SoC's. Currently planned SoC's are STM32H745/STM32H747 and STM32H755/STM32H757. If they are implemented fully, then I create a first release from the library which can be used.
